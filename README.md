Project remains in progress, but current state:

Executing LeagueClass.py will prompt the user for their ESPN League Id and a single season for which to acquire results. In addition, an optional argument will accept the IP Address for a PostgreSQL server (default value of localhost will work for databases running locally) in which to dump the transformed data.
